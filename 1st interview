what is the difference between curl and wget?
  We may wish to send HTTP requests without using a web browser or other interactive app.
  The main difference between them is that curl will show the output in the console. 
  On the other hand, wget will download it into a file
  $ curl -o outputfile.zip https://example.com/file.zip
  This command downloads file located at https://example.com/file.zip 
  and saves it as outputfile.zip. -o option specifies output file name.
 $ wget https://example.com/file.zip
  This command downloads file located at https://example.com/file.zip and saves it using original file name.

can we check which user is belongs to which groupd?
 $ groups username
 $ grep anil /etc/groups
